# Bamazon
An Amazon-like store run exclusively using Node and mySQL.

PROCESS

* Users view the stock of an online store and are asked if they want to make a purchase
* Using Node's terminal view, users select by the item's ID reflected from the mySQL database
* Via JS, the stock quantity for the item chosen is updated in real time, just like a real store
* The user is given their total cost and asked if they're done shopping, or ends the transaction

## CURRENT ISSUES

* First query is listed as "undefined"

## TECHNOLOGIES

* Node.js
* mySQL
* NPM Packages: inquirer, mysql
